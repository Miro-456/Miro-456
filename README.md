# Welcome
- 👋 Hi, My name is Marawan Essam.
- 👀 I’m interested in computers, programming and information technology. I'd want to be a programmer one day.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and Python. I may learn some other concepts and programming languages later.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: he, his, him (and so on...).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a fan of Beyblade and Sonic the Hedgehog, and you're probably gonna notice how many times I use parentheses "()" and emojis 😁. Also I don't know who is gonna contribute to this special repo other than me 🤷‍♂️. And also, this is a thunder.
- 🗂 Check out [My Portfoilo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Qiqmvkhkrz8VaEaaty0urfiqw7tpvT_)
 (The link was not working cuz the readme file wasn't counting the underscore in the link for unknown reasons, so I had to make it a hyperlink (well, I used parentheses for this hyperlink, too 😅))
- 😉 This README file may get an update sooner or later.
